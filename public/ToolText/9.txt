MassIt is a Rhino grasshopper script we developed for site planning and building programming with masses. 

Sometimes we feel frustrated by the endless modifications required due to changes in spatial strategy layout. Currently, we are attempting to add two new features to the original MassIt v3.9: 
one is a data-driven Building Section View, which can update the section views of each building in real time after you change the room ratio allocation or the mass size; 
the other is a Building Planning View driven by the sliced Rhino Mass model, which will update after you click "Slice All Building."

Although the current version only allows for a simplistic single-directional slicing of the building, we will strive to improve it to make it more adaptable and flexible in the future. Perhaps developing similar plugins in Revit and driving them with Revit's model data is also a good direction to explore.
