The Ragon Institute is a unique union of Mass General, MIT, and Harvard at the forefront of infectious disease research, such as HIV-AIDS and COVID-19. Its new 323,000 GSF home is located on a free-standing triangular site along Main Street at the edge of Kendall Square and the MIT Campus. Cantilevered dramatically on 3 corners, the design approach embraced the unusual triangular site as a singular object by floating the mass above a continuous band of landscape on all sides, and seamlessly navigating the gateway site and its varying alignments with the gentle sweep of its mass: its green roof fluidly sloping downward three stories around the block. The elliptical Courtyard Sweep carved into the mass further scales the profile and provides a dynamic silhouette along Main Street; it is an extension of the organically shaped atrium that defines the heart of the institute.
