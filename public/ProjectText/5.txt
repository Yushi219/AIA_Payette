Following PAYETTE’s 2012 Master Plan, 245 Beacon Street is a new 150,000 SF facility providing dedicated space for interdisciplinary science and liberal arts programs and is home to the College’s Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society. The building includes office and laboratory space, classrooms, maker spaces and common areas. 245 Beacon aligns with Boston College’s mission of supporting collaboration between the arts and humanities. As home to a new general engineering program, the building emphasizes research and student learning applied to complex problems beyond a single discipline, in the realms of energy, environment and health.
