The new Science and Engineering Complex is the product of a strategic infill addition that creates space for interdisciplinary research while connecting two historic buildings to form a dynamic, community focused, academic precinct. The complex addresses the Universityâ€™s desire for a critical mass of research and teaching space to support cross-departmental collaborations in an environmentally responsible manner. A glass box floats effortlessly between two historic red brick bookends. Its taut skin cradles and reflects its surroundings, complementing the brick and lending quiet dignity to the existing buildings.
