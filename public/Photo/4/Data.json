    "Description": "Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centerâ€™s new inpatient bed tower incorporates the expansion of hospital departments in the adjacent Rosenberg Building, while allowing it to remain in operation throughout construction. Departments will span between the new building and renovated space in Rosenberg. Bridge-like corridors will connect these functions and ease public circulation from the Rosenberg Building, through the inpatient building, to the rest of the West Campus. A palette of materials drawn from the nearby East Campus will link the two campuses.",
